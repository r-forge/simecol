  abstract = {Spring clear water phases caused by grazing of zooplankton on algae
	are among the most spectacular and well-studied events in lake plankton
	dynamics. Such clear water phases are also important as windows of
	opportunity for recovery of aquatic vegetation and biodiversity in
	shallow waters. Here we use long time series from 71 shallow lakes
	to demonstrate that the probability of clear water phase increases
	with the temperature of lake water. We demonstrate that lake temperature
	has risen significantly over the past decades and is highly correlated
	with oscillations in the North Atlantic climate system. We also show
	a distinct climate-related shift in the timing of clear water phases
	in the shallow lakes as well as in an independent set of central
	European lakes. Simulations with a seasonally forced plankton model
	confirm that temperature rise is a plausible explanation for the
	observed changes.}
