Description: An object oriented framework to simulate
  ecological (and other) dynamic systems. It can be used for
  differential equations, individual-based (or agent-based) and other
  models as well. The package helps to organize scenarios (to avoid copy
  and paste) and aims to improve readability and usability of code.
