  abstract = {Programming environments such as S and Lisp-Stat have languages for
	performing computations, data storage mechanisms, and a graphical
	interface. These languages provide an interactive interface to data
	analysis that is invaluable. To take full advantage of these programming
	environments, statisticians must understand the differences between
	them. Ihaka and Gentleman introduced R, a version of S which uses
	a different scoping regimen. In some ways this makes R behave more
	like Lisp-Stat. This article discusses the concept of scoping rules
	and shows how lexical scope can enhance the functionality of a language.
