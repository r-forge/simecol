0.6-7

o fixed bug in documentation example for iteration-solver

0.6-6

o tested on Linux x64 with gcc and Sun Studio 12 compilers
o vignette improvements


0.6-5

o changed: simecol.cpp to simecol.c
  to avoid C++ (we didn't need it yet)

0.6-4

o try to fix comptibility issue with Sun Studio compiler

0.6-3

o remove Rdversion, back compatibility with R 2.8.1
o submitted to CRAN

0.6-2

o fitOdeModel supports now PORT algorithm (nlminb)
o documentation improvements
o first version of "simecol-howto"
o new utility mixNamedVec
o submitted to CRAN

0.6-1

o start writing new vignette "simecol-howto"
o data frame conversion for outputs of class odeModel now only for matrices and
in out, not in sim.

0.6

o new class indbasedModel
o new slot "observer"
o .Rdata files re-generated (with observer slot)
o simulation re-initializes objects that have an initfunc
o example of an ODE model that passes compiled code directly to the solver
o this is the useR!2008 (Dortmund) release 

0.5-7

o the package uses now deSolve instead of odesolve
o euler is now imported from deSolve and removed from simecol
o allow solver slot to contain not only character but also function
o plain version of JSS publication added as vignette

0.5-6

o small improvements and updates 

0.5-5

o reworked ODE solvers, rk4 and lsoda generics removed,
  solvers are now called directly from sim,
  ensures compatibility with the desolve package without
  the need to write generics for all possible (and future)
  ode solvers
o rehabilitation of addtoenv()
o documentation updates
o replacement functions now delete slot "out"

0.5-4

o experimental code for parameter fitting of ODE models

0.5-3

o added citation to JSS article about simecol
o removed obsolete \non_function{} entry from documentation
o conversion of simObj to and from lists, as.list and as.simObj
o bivariate uniform random numbers (Plackett distribution)

0.5-2

o tcltk is now Suggested again 
  (possible due to relaxed package check conditions)

0.5-1

o fixed obsolete braces in .Rd's

0.5

o tcltk is now mandatory (in Depends), to solve issue
  with package check under R 2.6.0 (under development)
o check for empty out-slot in plot methods
o obsolete comments removed
o small documentation updates
  - addtoenv may be removed in the future
o version 0.5 is used in the upcoming JSS article

0.4-3

o addtoenv() is no longer used in the solver functions
o standard conform accessor functions 
  --> Attention: old applications may need adaptions!
o added demo("jss", package="simecol")
o new examples, small code and documentation improvements

0.4-2

o helper classes: listOrNULL and functionOrNULL
o new slot initfunc, initialize method and 
  complete rewrite of constructors
o new print and show methods
o general code cleanup and several bugfixes
o documentation improvements


0.4-1

o general code cleanup
o iteration is now a generic function
o ... argument added to get-functions
o argument "last" in out()

0.3-14

o euler method for numerical integration

0.3-11 - 0.3-13

several bugfixes and documentation improvements

0.3-10

o some bug fixes and error checking in the accessor functions

0.3-9

o documentation improvements

0.3-8

o made rk4 a generic. This required to include a copy of the 
  original rk4 from the odesolve package but this cosmetic issue
  will be fixed as soon as possible
o improvements of documentation

0.3-7

o renamed class rndwalkModel to rwalkModel
o code cleanup and error checking
o changed implementation of 'selfrefer' and renamed to 'addtoenv'
o documentation issues
o bugfixes

0.3-6

o version presented at useR-2006
o slot 'equations' renamed to 'main'
o new slot 'equations' holding sub-equations callable in main

0.3.1 ... 0.3.5

o complete rewrite using S4 classes instead of S3 lists
o rename of classes and several functions
o several examples and utility functions removed,
  they will appear again in future versions,  separate
  packages or as downloadable examples on WWW.
o the 0.3 branch is incompatible to 0.2.x versions of simecol
o if you have problems porting old models, 
  please ask me for assistance.
